**My To-Do List**

- [x] Find a Github repo to use - https://github.com/kitplummer/clikan *edit* might use this one instead https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibtgxp2EtcQ
- [ ] Decide if I want to use this command line based to do list or dive into fancy frameworks
- [x] Decided between moscow or rice *edit* going to use moscow instead because you can use rice on Jira and I think the math would be too hard
- [ ] Find out what im getting myself into
- [ ] Find a couple good tutorial videos
