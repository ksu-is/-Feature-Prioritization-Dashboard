**My To-Do List**

- [x] Find a Github repo to use - https://github.com/kitplummer/clikan *edit* might use this one instead https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibtgxp2EtcQ
- [x] Decide if I want to use this command line based to do list or dive into fancy frameworks *edit* Going to use tkinter maybe 
- [x] Decided between moscow or rice *edit* going to use moscow instead because you can use rice on Jira and I think the math would be too hard
- [x] Find out what im getting myself into
- [x] Find a couple good tutorial videos
- [x] Turn kanban board into moscow
- [x] tkinter looks ugly so at some point follow this and make it look better https://medium.com/@fareedkhandev/modern-gui-using-tkinter-12da0b983e22 *edit* NOT USING THIS, there are things that exist in tkinter that dont exist in customtkinter and changing the syntax wasnt as easy as I thought.
- [x] Make text drop a line if its longer than the width of the box *Edit* not doing this because if its too long you can just resize the window
- [x] Make it to where you can drag and drop tasks between boxes *edit* I cant find ANY tutorials, documentation, or forums discussing this..... used chatgpt
- [x] Make it to where you cant enter the "enter a task here prompt
- [x] BIG Maybe but, make it to where you can save and re open saved project files *Edit* This has been a rabbithole.
