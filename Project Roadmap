**My To-Do List**

- [x] Find a Github repo to use - https://github.com/kitplummer/clikan *edit* might use this one instead https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibtgxp2EtcQ
- [x] Decide if I want to use this command line based to do list or dive into fancy frameworks *edit* Going to use tkinter maybe 
- [x] Decided between moscow or rice *edit* going to use moscow instead because you can use rice on Jira and I think the math would be too hard
- [x] Find out what im getting myself into
- [x] Find a couple good tutorial videos
- [ ] Turn kanban board into moscow
- [ ] tkinter looks ugly so at some point follow this and make it look better https://medium.com/@fareedkhandev/modern-gui-using-tkinter-12da0b983e22
